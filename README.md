# zines

# A repository to hold the different educational zines I have created for scientific projects or outreach events. 

Instructions on how to fold zines are available here: [How to make a zine from one piece of printer paper - The Orgonian YouTube Channel](https://youtu.be/Ixqr9e3wCxI)

### Currently available zines include:
- Cabbages and their cousins: the dogs of the plant world (made for Cayuga Junior/High School as part of the GRASSHOPR program)
- Seed domestication and adaptation: a seed dispersal game (made for Expanding Your Horizons workshop)
- Elucidating the patterns of pleiotropy and its biological relevance in maize (made for the Population, Evolutionary, and Quantitative Genetics Conference, 2022)
- Jumping into gene regulation: understanding the regulatory adaptation of transposable elements and their effect on gene expression in maize (made for the SACNAS National Diversity in STEM Meeting, 2022)
